#BEGIN_COMMENT
# Some sections are evaluated for size multiple times(a trampoline insert that
# changes section sizes, will reevaluat all expressions again, because of
# section size, which results in VMA increase). The first few times, the section
# got a virtual address, that resulted in the expression producing some file
# size. Finally when everything was stable, the linker continued to use the old
# section size for sections that need the size to be computed again (that is
# sections that have only expressions).
