#BEGIN_COMMENT
# Linker fails to parse the entry symbol as address, and doesnot associate the
# entry field in the ELF header to the value specified by the user. The linker
# also emits a warning for this. The way entry symbol associated with a value
# works is by treating entry symbol with an address separately with the entry
# section that is needed for Garbage collection. If the entry symbol is found
# then the entry symbol is chosen as one of the root set symbols for garbage
# collection.
